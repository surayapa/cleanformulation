CleanFormulation Research Methodology

Framework for Structured Analysis of Soaps, Detergents, and Cleansing Systems

1. Introduction

CleanFormulation is an independent analytical framework designed to examine soaps, detergents, and cleansing-related cosmetic products through structured formulation analysis, ingredient role mapping, and regulatory context interpretation.

This whitepaper defines the methodological architecture used to evaluate cleansing products in a consistent, repeatable, and non-promotional manner.

The framework is educational and explanatory in nature. It does not provide medical advice, safety certifications, or regulatory determinations.

2. Core Objectives

The CleanFormulation research system aims to:

Clarify how cleansing systems function at a chemical and formulation level.

Map ingredient lists to functional roles within a product.

Distinguish between formulation behavior and marketing language.

Provide structured interpretation boundaries.

Document repeatable evaluation protocols.

Maintain neutrality in analysis and presentation.

3. Scope of Evaluation

The methodology applies to:

Traditional alkaline bar soaps

Liquid soap systems

Syndet (synthetic detergent) cleansing bars

Body washes and face cleansers

Hand wash formulations

Laundry detergents (including HE systems)

Dishwashing detergents

Antibacterial and antimicrobial-labeled cleansing products

Ingredient-level analysis

The system does not evaluate:

Therapeutic outcomes

Dermatological diagnoses

Consumer-specific reactions

Clinical safety determinations

4. Foundational Principles
4.1 Functional Neutrality

Ingredients are described according to functional purpose rather than assumed benefit or harm.

4.2 System-Level Context

No ingredient is evaluated in isolation.
Interpretation occurs within formulation context, including:

pH range

Surfactant system type

Water hardness interaction

Dilution conditions

Rinse-off behavior

4.3 Evidence Referencing

Information sources may include:

Regulatory agency publications

INCI databases

Peer-reviewed literature

Public formulation chemistry texts

Safety assessment reports

Evidence is presented descriptively without extrapolating beyond documented scope.

4.4 Limitation Transparency

Each analysis acknowledges:

Data constraints

Absence of proprietary formula details

Assumptions made during interpretation

Uncertainty in concentration ranges

5. Structured Ingredient Evaluation Model

Each ingredient analysis follows a standardized structure:

5.1 Ingredient Identification

INCI name

Common name (if applicable)

Chemical classification

5.2 Functional Role Classification

Ingredients are categorized into functional roles such as:

Primary surfactant

Secondary surfactant

Amphoteric surfactant

Chelating agent

Preservative system

Fragrance component

Buffering agent

Thickener

Emollient

Solvent

Colorant

5.3 Formulation Behavior Context

Discussion includes:

Interaction with other surfactants

Foam characteristics

Hard water compatibility

Potential residue formation

Rinsing behavior

Stability contribution

5.4 Regulatory Context

When relevant:

Cosmetic vs drug classification boundaries

Antibacterial labeling considerations

Jurisdictional variation in claims

5.5 Common Misconceptions

Clarification of widely misunderstood properties or assumptions.

5.6 Interpretation Boundaries

Explicit statement of what cannot be concluded without concentration data or laboratory testing.

6. Product-Level Analytical Framework

When evaluating a finished product, the following steps are applied:

6.1 Ingredient List Parsing

Order analysis (descending concentration assumption)

Surfactant system identification

Soap vs syndet differentiation

6.2 System Type Classification

Products are classified as:

True soap (alkaline salt of fatty acid)

Syndet system

Hybrid soap-syndet blend

Detergent system

Foaming surfactant cleanser

6.3 Structural Feature Identification

Superfatting indicators

Conditioning agents

Chelation presence

Preservative systems

Fragrance composition indicators

6.4 Functional Performance Inference

Based on known surfactant chemistry, potential performance traits may be described, including:

Expected lather type

Residue probability

Hard water behavior

Rinse characteristics

These are presented as structural expectations, not performance guarantees.

7. Research Protocol Architecture

CleanFormulation employs structured analytical protocols to model formulation behavior. Examples include:

Bar vs liquid cleansing system comparison

Contact-time modeling

Hard water interaction modeling

Sweat simulation modeling

Zinc vs non-zinc odor control modeling

Each protocol defines:

Assumptions

Controlled variables

Measurement logic

Scoring framework (where applicable)

Interpretation boundaries

Protocols are theoretical and educational in structure unless otherwise specified.

8. Data Transparency Model

Where datasets are provided, they may include:

Raw scoring sheets

Comparative matrices

Replication templates

Model worksheets

Data is presented for interpretive purposes and does not represent certified laboratory validation.

9. Editorial Safeguards

CleanFormulation maintains the following editorial controls:

No affiliate ranking systems

No sponsored bias disclosure gaps

No health outcome claims

No fear-based framing

No “safe/unsafe” labeling

No dermatological verdicts

No purchasing recommendations

The framework emphasizes structural clarity over advocacy.

10. Ethical Position

The project does not:

Represent regulatory agencies

Conduct medical evaluation

Provide diagnostic advice

Issue certification statements

It aims to reduce confusion between marketing terminology and formulation chemistry through structured explanation.

11. Limitations of Methodology

The CleanFormulation system acknowledges:

Lack of access to proprietary concentration data

Inability to perform laboratory testing on all products

Jurisdictional variability in regulation

Variability in consumer interpretation of labeling

Changing formulations over time

All conclusions are bounded by publicly available information and structured analytical reasoning.

12. Conclusion

The CleanFormulation Research Methodology establishes a repeatable, transparent, and neutral system for evaluating soaps, detergents, and cleansing-related cosmetic products.

It provides:

A structured lens for ingredient interpretation

A consistent product evaluation framework

Clearly defined interpretive limits

A separation between explanation and advocacy

The objective is educational clarity through formulation science, not product endorsement or condemnation.
