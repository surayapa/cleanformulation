# CleanFormulation Taxonomy Model

Version: 1.0  
Status: Foundational Classification Framework  

---

## 1. Purpose

The CleanFormulation Taxonomy Model defines the classification system used to organize ingredients, product systems, formulation roles, and regulatory contexts within the CleanFormulation research framework.

This taxonomy ensures:

- Structural consistency
- Repeatable categorization
- Neutral classification
- Clear interpretive boundaries
- Transparent data organization

The taxonomy does not rank products or assign safety verdicts.

---

## 2. High-Level Classification Structure

CleanFormulation organizes content into four primary domains:

1. Product System Type
2. Ingredient Functional Role
3. Regulatory Positioning
4. Claim & Marketing Language Context

---

## 3. Product System Classification

### 3.1 Soap Systems

Defined as alkaline salts of fatty acids formed via saponification.

Subcategories:

- Cold process bar soap
- Hot process bar soap
- Melt and pour soap base

- Superfatted soap systems
- High-oleic soap systems
- High-lauric cleansing bars

Characteristics:

- Alkaline pH
- Fatty acid salt chemistry
- Hard water interaction potential

---

### 3.2 Syndet Systems

Synthetic detergent-based cleansing systems.

Subcategories:

- Syndet cleansing bars
- Liquid body wash systems
- Facial cleanser systems
- Foaming hand wash
- Amphoteric-rich systems
- Sulfate-based systems
- Sulfate-free systems

Characteristics:

- Neutral to mildly acidic pH
- Surfactant blends
- Chelator inclusion common

---

### 3.3 Detergent Systems

Laundry and dishwashing formulations.

Subcategories:

- HE (High Efficiency) laundry detergent
- Standard washer detergent
- Powder detergent
- Liquid detergent
- Dishwashing liquid
- Automatic dishwasher detergent

Characteristics:

- Builder systems
- Enzyme inclusion (in some cases)
- Hard water performance optimization

---

### 3.4 Hybrid Systems

Formulations containing both soap and synthetic surfactants.

---

## 4. Ingredient Functional Role Classification

Ingredients are categorized by functional contribution, not by marketing claim.

### 4.1 Primary Surfactants
- Anionic surfactants
- Nonionic surfactants
- Amphoteric surfactants
- Cationic surfactants (rare in cleansing phase)

### 4.2 Secondary Surfactants / Co-Surfactants

Used to:
- Modify foam structure
- Reduce harshness perception
- Improve mildness profile

---

### 4.3 Chelating Agents
- EDTA variants
- Citrates
- Gluconates

Function:
- Hard water ion binding
- Stability support

---

### 4.4 Preservative Systems
- Formaldehyde-releasing preservatives
- Organic acid preservatives
- Paraben class preservatives
- Isothiazolinones

Classification is descriptive, not evaluative.

---

### 4.5 Fragrance Components
- Synthetic fragrance blends
- Essential oils
- Isolated aroma chemicals

---

### 4.6 Emollients / Conditioning Agents
- Plant oils
- Esters
- Silicones
- Fatty alcohols

---

### 4.7 pH Modifiers / Buffers
- Citric acid
- Sodium hydroxide
- Triethanolamine

---

### 4.8 Structural Agents
- Thickeners
- Gelling agents
- Stabilizers

---

### 4.9 Colorants
- Synthetic dyes
- Iron oxides
- Mica-based pigments

---

## 5. Regulatory Position Classification

CleanFormulation distinguishes between:

### 5.1 Cosmetic Classification
Products intended for cleansing or beautification without therapeutic claims.

### 5.2 Drug Classification (Jurisdiction Dependent)
Products making antibacterial, antiseptic, or therapeutic claims.

### 5.3 Dual-Category Products
Products classified differently depending on jurisdiction.

This classification is contextual and not a regulatory ruling.

---

## 6. Claim Type Taxonomy

Marketing language is categorized structurally:

### 6.1 Functional Claims
- Cleansing
- Moisturizing
- Gentle
- Deep-cleaning

### 6.2 Ingredient-Based Claims
- Sulfate-free
- Paraben-free
- Fragrance-free
- Natural

### 6.3 Performance Claims
- Antibacterial
- Odor-eliminating
- Long-lasting freshness

### 6.4 Sensory Claims
- Soft skin
- Fresh scent
- Creamy lather

Claims are described; they are not validated or rejected within taxonomy.

---

## 7. Formulation Behavior Attributes

Products may be classified by:

- Expected foam density
- Hard water compatibility
- Residue probability
- pH profile
- Rinsing behavior
- Surfactant strength category

These attributes are inferred from structural chemistry.

---

## 8. Data Layer Classification

Where applicable, datasets may include:

- Ingredient role tags
- Surfactant category tags
- System type identifiers
- Regulatory context markers
- Claim-type identifiers

This enables structured data analysis without value ranking.

---

## 9. Interpretation Boundaries

The taxonomy:

- Does not assign safety grades
- Does not provide medical recommendations
- Does not determine regulatory compliance
- Does not measure concentration unless published

It serves as a structural organization tool.

---

## 10. Versioning & Updates

The taxonomy may evolve to reflect:

- Regulatory changes
- New surfactant technologies
- Updated INCI standards
- Structural improvements in classification logic

Version changes will be documented in repository history.
