# CleanFormulation

CleanFormulation is an independent, research-based framework dedicated to analyzing soaps, detergents, and cleansing-related cosmetic products through formulation science, regulatory context, and ingredient transparency.

## Research Documentation
- [Research Methodology Whitepaper](methodology/CleanFormulation-Research-Methodology.md)

This repository documents the methodology, structural framework, and evaluation principles that guide the CleanFormulation research system.

## Purpose

CleanFormulation exists to:

- Explain how soaps and detergents function at a formulation level
- Clarify ingredient roles using chemistry-based reasoning
- Distinguish marketing language from formulation reality
- Provide neutral, structured interpretation of product ingredient lists
- Document repeatable research protocols for formulation behavior analysis

The project does not provide medical advice, safety verdicts, or consumer diagnoses.  
It is an educational and analytical framework.

---

## Scope

The CleanFormulation research system covers:

- Bar soaps (traditional alkaline soap systems)
- Liquid soaps
- Syndet (synthetic detergent) cleansers
- Laundry detergents (including HE systems)
- Dishwashing formulations
- Cosmetic cleansing products (face wash, hand wash, body wash)
- Ingredient behavior analysis
- Regulatory classification context
- Label interpretation structure

---

## Methodology Overview

CleanFormulation follows a structured evaluation model:

1. **Ingredient Identification**
   - INCI-based naming
   - Functional classification
   - Surfactant categorization

2. **Functional Role Mapping**
   - Cleansing agent
   - Co-surfactant
   - Chelator
   - Preservative
   - Fragrance component
   - Buffer system
   - Conditioning additive

3. **Formulation Context**
   - Soap vs syndet distinction
   - Alkaline vs neutral systems
   - Hard water interaction
   - Rinsing behavior
   - Residue formation potential

4. **Regulatory Classification**
   - Cosmetic vs drug designation (jurisdiction dependent)
   - Antibacterial claim boundaries
   - Label compliance considerations

5. **Evidence Referencing**
   - Regulatory documents
   - Ingredient databases
   - Peer-reviewed literature
   - Standardized chemical references

The system separates:
- Explanation
- Evidence
- Limitations

No conclusions are framed as medical or safety judgments.

---

## Research Protocols

CleanFormulation includes standardized, repeatable methodology models such as:

- Bar vs liquid comparative frameworks
- Contact-time modeling structures
- Residue interaction analysis
- Sweat simulation modeling
- Zinc vs non-zinc deodorization comparison

These protocols are designed to document:
- Assumptions
- Variables
- Measurement logic
- Interpretation boundaries

Protocols are educational in nature and do not represent laboratory certification.

---

## Ingredient Analysis Structure

Each ingredient analysis follows a consistent template:

- What the ingredient is
- Chemical classification
- Functional purpose in formulation
- Interaction behavior in systems
- Common misconceptions
- Regulatory context (where applicable)
- Evidence references
- Known limitations of interpretation

The objective is clarity, not endorsement or condemnation.

---

## Editorial Principles

CleanFormulation adheres to:

- Neutral tone
- Non-promotional language
- No affiliate bias
- No product ranking systems
- No fear-based framing
- No medical or therapeutic claims
- Transparent citation standards

The platform does not provide consumer purchasing advice.

---

## Data & Transparency

Where applicable, the project may provide:

- Structured datasets
- Protocol worksheets
- Sample scoring templates
- Open reference frameworks

All content reflects independent research interpretation.
